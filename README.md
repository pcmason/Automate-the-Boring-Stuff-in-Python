# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-in-Python
I have been going through Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" in my free time and can be found online here: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc . 
This repository is where I will be posting useful examples from the book and my solutions to practice problems given, along with other projects that have been inspired from the readings.
